# Molecular-Surface-and-Pore-Size-Analysis-using-MDAnalysis-and-SciPy
This repository contains a Python script designed to calculate the surface area, volume, and pore size distribution of molecules using atomic positions from XYZ files. The script leverages MDAnalysis for molecular data processing and SciPy's ConvexHull for geometric computations.
